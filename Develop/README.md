Password Generator 

## Description
What was your motivation?
My motviation for working on the Password Generator project is to grow/develop my developer skills. This was a difficult project but once broken down into smaller steps I was starting to understand the functionality. I still have a long way to go but i'm excited for the journey. 
Why did you build this project?
I built this project to add to my developer Github portfolio and show the improvement i'm making throughout my journey.

This project solves the problem of a user creating a weak password. The Password Generator allows an easy to use password generator option for the user to create their password their own way.
What did you learn?
I learned about the different ways variables, arrays, and other javascript functions can be used to create a functional website. You never stop learning as a developer
